# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# SHoang_Portoflio
This is a simple portfolio made using react for Sebastian Hoang. It is a simplified portfolio made due to time constraint (see note). The portfolio features an about section with a photo and timeline of events. Following that is a resume that is then followed by a portfolio of work. At the bottom is the link to my github account.
